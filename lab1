When using cd command with no arguments, the terminal does not change directories. When we use cd with a path to a directory as an argument, this changes our directory to the folder we point it to (in this case we changed directory to lecture 1). This allows us to have a working terminal in lecture1. When we use a file as an argument for cd, we get an error message. This is because our txt file is not a directory and we cannot navigate into them.
